Problem Title: Array Max Result

Description: the instructions didn't match the name of this challenge, but here they are as I read them:

1. Ask the user for five integers between 1 - 10 (not inclusive).
2. Display those five integers back to the user.
3. Ask the user to choose an integer from the array.
4. Compute a "score" that is the number of times that integer occurs multiplied by the integer itself.
5. Display the score to the user.
